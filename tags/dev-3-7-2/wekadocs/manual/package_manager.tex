The Package Manager provides a graphical interface to Weka's package
management system. All the functionality available in the command line
client to the package management system covered in the previous
Chapter is available in the GUI version, along with the ability to
install and uninstall multiple packages in one hit.

\section{Main window}

\begin{center}

\end{center}

The package manager's window is split horizontally into two parts: at
the top is a list of packages and at the bottom is a mini browser that
can be used to display information on the currently selected
package. 

The package list shows the name of a package, its category, the
currently installed version (if installed), the latest version
available via the repository and whether the package has been loaded
or not. This list may be sorted by either package name or category by
clicking on the appropriate column header. A second click on the same
header reverses the sort order. Three radio buttons in the upper left
of the window can be used to filter what is displayed in the list. All
packages (default), all available packages (i.e. those not yet
installed) or only installed packages can be displayed.

If multiple versions of a package are available, they can be accessed by
clicking on an entry in the ``Repository version'' column:

\end{center}

\section{Installing and removing packages}

At the very top of the window are three buttons. On the left-hand side
is a button that can be used to refresh the cached copy of the package
repository meta data. The first time that the package manager (GUI or
command line) is used there will be a short delay as the initial cache
is established. \textbf{NOTE: Weka will not automatically check for
new information at the central repository, so it is a good idea to
refresh the local cache regularly}.

The two buttons at the top right are used to install and remove
packages repspectively. Multiple packages may be installed/removed by
using a shift-left-click combination to select a range and/or by using
a command-left-click combination to add to the selection. Underneath
the install and uninstall buttons is a checkbox that can be enabled to
ignore any dependencies required by selected packages and any
conflicts that may occur. Installing packages while this checkbox is
selected will \textbf{not} install required dependencies.

Some packages may have additional information on how to complete the
installation or special instructions that gets displayed when the
package is installed:

\end{center}

Usually it is not necessary to restart Weka after packages have been
installed---the changes should be available immediately. An exception
is when upgrading a package that is already installed. If in doubt, 
restart Weka.

\section{Using a http proxy}

Both the GUI and command line package managers can operate via a http proxy. To do so,
start Weka from the command line and supply property values for the proxy host and port:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  java -Dhttp.proxyHost=some.proxy.somewhere.net -Dhttp.proxyPort=port weka.gui.GUIChooser
\end{verbatim}}

If your proxy requires authentication, then two more (non-standard) properties can be
supplied:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  -Dhttp.proxyUser=some_user_name -Dhttp.proxyPassword=some_password
\end{verbatim}}

\section{Using an alternative central package meta data repository}

By default, both the command-line and GUI package managers use the
central package meta data repository hosted on Sourceforge. In the
unlikely event that this site is unavailable for one reason or
another, it is possible to point the package management system at an
alternative repository. This mechanism allows a temporary backup of
the official repostory to be accessed, local mirrors to be established
and alternative repositories to be set up for use etc.

An alternative repository can be specified by setting a Java property:

{\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  weka.core.wekaPackageRepositoryURL=http://some.mirror.somewhere
\end{verbatim}}

This can either be set when starting Weka from the command line with
the \texttt{-D} flag, or it can be placed into a file called
``PackageRepository.props'' in \verb=$WEKA_HOME/props=. The default
value of \verb=WEKA_HOME= is \verb=user.home/wekafiles=, where
\verb=user.home= is the user's home directory. More information on how
and where Weka stores configuration information is given in the
Appendix (Chapter 19).
