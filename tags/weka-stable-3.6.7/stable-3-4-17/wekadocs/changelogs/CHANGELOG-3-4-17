Cluster priors were wrong when iteration terminates due to non-improvement of log likelihood. This is because the E step is used to compute the likelihood *and* to also update the weights and recompute the priors. When iterate exits at iteration i because the likelihood doesn't increase, then the E step has actually advanced the priors to iteration i+1. Fixed.

The out-of-bag error computation was using voting for classification instead of averaging the probability estimates (as is done in distributionForInstance). Changed to make it consistent.

MLP was returning null from distributionForInstance when the array of probabilities contained a
ll zeros! Fixed - now uses the ZeroR model in this case. This bug manifested itself on the lett
er recognition data when the network was trained with -M 0.8 and -L 0.5 using a 2/3 1/3 split (
one instance resulted in an array of all zeros).

The clusterInstance method was downdating node stats using the instance to be clustered before finding the best host and then restoring the status quo. This probably makes sense for clustering the same data that was used to generate the tree, but doesn't really make sense for clustering new data.

Was using the normalize filter, but should have been standardizing the data (for PCs computed from the correlation matrix) - fixed. Now also has an option to center the data and compute PCs from the covariance matrix. Transforming back to the original space now correctly reverses standardization/centering.
