/**
 * Class for a Naive Bayes classifier using estimator classes. This is the
 * updateable version of NaiveBayes.
 * This classifier will use a default precision of 0.1 for numeric attributes
 * when buildClassifier is called with zero training instances.

 * Continuous Distributions in Bayesian Classifiers</i>. Proceedings

 * Intelligence. pp. 338-345. Morgan Kaufmann, San Mateo.<p>
 *
 * Valid options are:<p>
 *
 * -K <br>
 * Use kernel estimation for modelling numeric attributes rather than
 * a single normal distribution.<p>
